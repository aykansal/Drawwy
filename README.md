Drawwy is a *browser-based pixel art editor* where you can draw, vibe, and then lock your creations forever on-chain with [Arweave Protocol](https://www.arweave.org).

## 🖌️ Features (aka the secret sauce)
- 🧩 Grid sizes: 8×8, 16×16, 32×32, 48×48  
- 🎨 Full color palette (plus add-your-own chaos colors)  
- ↩️ Undo / redo (because happy accidents are optional)  
- 💻 Save progress locally in your browser  
- 🔗 Publish permanently on Arweave (art + grid + manifest)  
- 🌍 Shareable links that never expire  
- 👀 Community gallery to snoop what others are cooking up  


## 🤔 How it Works
1. 🎨 You draw → pixels live in your browser.  
2. 📦 Hit publish → Drawwy bundles your art, data, and metadata.  
3. ⛓️ Uploaded to Arweave → permanent, unkillable link forever.  

Dead servers? Nah. Broken URLs? Couldn’t be us.
